The SocketLabs Email Delivery C# library allows you to easily send email messages via the [SocketLabs Injection API](https://www.socketlabs.com/docs/inject/).  The library makes it easy to build and send any type of message supported by the API, from a simple message to a single recipient all the way to a complex bulk message sent to a group of recipients with unique merge data per recipient.

# Prerequisites and Installation
## Prerequisites
* A supported .NET version
  * .NET version 4.5 or higher
  * .NET Core 1.0 or higher
  * .NET Standard 1.3 or higher
* A SocketLabs account. If you don't have one yet, you can [sign up for a free account](https://signup.socketlabs.com/step-1?plan=free) to get started.

## Installation
For most uses we recommend installing the SocketLabs.EmailDelivery package via Nuget. If you have the [Nuget Package Manager](https://www.nuget.org/) installed already, you can add the latest version of the package with the following command:

```
PM> Install-Package SocketLabs.EmailDelivery
```

Adding a Package Reference to your project:

```
<PackageReference Include="SocketLabs.EmailDelivery" Version="1.4.3" />
```

.NET CLI users can also use the following command:

```
> dotnet add package SocketLabs.EmailDelivery
```


Alternately, you can simply [clone this repository](https://github.com/socketlabs/socketlabs-csharp.git) directly to include the source code in your project.

**Note for Visual Studio 2012 and earlier users**: Due to an issue with dependency requirements, the package manager in VS2012
and earlier does not support installation of the current nuget package. In order to install the package directly, all you need to do
is download the latest release binaries located at [https://github.com/socketlabs/socketlabs-csharp/releases/](https://github.com/socketlabs/socketlabs-csharp/releases/).
Once you download the zip file, extract the files, and add the dll's from ```the lib\net45``` directory as references.
You can do this from the project menu by clicking "Add Reference" then going to the browse option and picking the dll's from there.

# Getting Started
## Obtaining your API Key and SocketLabs ServerId number
In order to get started, you'll need to enable the Injection API feature in the [SocketLabs Control Panel](https://cp.socketlabs.com).
Once logged in, navigate to your SocketLabs server's dashboard (if you only have one server on your account you'll be taken here immediately after logging in).
Make note of your 4 or 5 digit ServerId number, as you'll need this along with
your API key in order to use the Injection API.

To enable the Injection API, click on the "For Developers" dropdown on the top-level navigation, then choose the "Configure HTTP Injection API" option.
Once here, you can enable the feature by choosing the "Enabled" option in the
dropdown. Enabling the feature will also generate your API key, which you'll
need (along with your ServerId) to start using the API. Be sure to click the
"Update" button to save your changes once you are finished.

## Quick Send
The `QuickSend()` method is a static method that allows you to quickly and easily send a message to a single recipient without the need for any setup code or even instantiating a client!

```C#
using SocketLabs.InjectionApi;

SocketLabsClient.QuickSend(
                000001, //Your SocketLabs ServerId
                "YOUR-API-KEY", //Your Injection API Key
                "recipient@example.com", //The To address for your message
                "from@example.com", //The From address for your message
                "Lorem Ipsum", //The Subject line for your message
                "<html>Lorem Ipsum</html>", //The HTML content for your message
                "Lorem Ipsum" //The plaintext content for your message
            );
```

## Basic Message
A basic message is an email message like you'd send from a personal email client such as Outlook.
A basic message can have many recipients, including multiple To addresses, CC addresses, and even BCC addresses.
You can also send a file attachment in a basic message.

```C#
using SocketLabs.InjectionApi;
using SocketLabs.InjectionApi.Message;

var client = new SocketLabsClient(000001, "YOUR-API-KEY"); //Your SocketLabs ServerId and Injection API key

var message = new BasicMessage();

message.Subject = "Sending A BasicMessage";
message.HtmlBody = "<html>This is the Html Body of my message.</html>";
message.PlainTextBody = "This is the Plain Text Body of my message.";

message.From.Email = "from@example.com";

//A basic message supports up to 50 recipients and supports several different ways to add recipients
message.To.Add("recipient1@example.com"); //Add a To address by passing the email address
message.Cc.Add("recipient2@example.com", "Recipient #2"); //Add a CC address by passing the email address and a friendly name
message.Bcc.Add(new EmailAddress("recipient3@example.com")); //Add a BCC address by passing an EmailAddress object

var response = client.Send(message);
```

## Bulk Message
A bulk message usually contains a single recipient per message
and is generally used to send the same content to many recipients,
optionally customizing the message via the use of MergeData.
For more information about using Merge data, please see the [Injection API documentation](https://www.socketlabs.com/docs/inject/).
```C#
using SocketLabs.InjectionApi;
using SocketLabs.InjectionApi.Message;

var client = new SocketLabsClient(000001, "YOUR-API-KEY"); //Your SocketLabs ServerId and Injection API key

var message = new BulkMessage();

message.PlainTextBody = "This is the body of my message sent to %%Name%%";
message.HtmlBody = "<html>This is the HtmlBody of my message sent to %%Name%%</html>";
message.Subject = "Sending a test message";
message.From.Email = "from@example.com";

var recipient1 = message.To.Add("recipient1@example.com");
recipient1.MergeData.Add("Name","Recipient1");

var recipient2 = message.To.Add("recipient2@example.com");
recipient2.MergeData.Add("Name","Recipient2");

var response = client.Send(message);
```

## Managing API Keys
For ease of demonstration, many of our examples include the ServerId and API
key directly in our code sample. Generally it is not considered a good practice
to store sensitive information like this directly in your code. Depending on
your project type, we recommend either storing your credentials in an `app.config` or a `web.config` file, or using Environment Variables. For more
information please see:
* [Using web.config](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/identity/overview/features-api/best-practices-for-deploying-passwords-and-other-sensitive-data-to-aspnet-and-azure)
* [Using Environment Variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environment.getenvironmentvariable)

## Examples and Use Cases
